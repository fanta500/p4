# P4: Portable Parallel Processing Pipelines

P4 is designed for building high-performance and interactive system for exploratory analysis and visualization of big data. P4 provides high performance by leveraging GPU computing to accelerate both data processing and rendering, while offering a simple programming interface with declarative grammars for rapid specification of data transformations, visualizations, and interactions.

The mission of P4 is to help more people use data analytics and visualization with GPU computing. P4 allows visualization designers and system developers with little or no knowledge in parallel programming and GPU computing to develop data analytics and visualization applications that efficiently run on the GPU.
